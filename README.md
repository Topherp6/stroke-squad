# BME 3053C: Stroke Squad

## Background
Our code was written to aid identification of cerebral infarctions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Ischemic strokes result from the obstruction of blood supply to the brain and account for 87% of all strokes. Prolonged inhibition of blood flow to the affected area can result in localized tissue death, known as an infarction. Up to 50% of adults are affected by silent cerebral infarctions, asymptomatic strokes, the effects of which only recognized through MRI. The goal of this study is to conduct a threshold image analysis using MATLAB to compare MRI images of both healthy and post ischemic-stroke patients to aid in the identification of cerebral infarctions. MRI is frequently used in identifying ischemic strokes due to their high spatial resolution and prove to be more effective than neurological examination and clinical history as a diagnostic tool. Current methods of recognizing infarctions in MRI images rely on neuroradiologists trained in recognizing key features for these diagnoses. While fairly accurate, studies have shown error up to 3.8% when using diffusion-weighted imaging to identify acute isometric strokes. Both the amount of training needed to accurately identify cerebral infarctions and the potential for error create the need for an improved method of analysis. 

## Usage
Normal (non-ischemic) MRI images should be in a folder in the directory labeled "Normal Images" and the images to be tested should be in a folder in the directory labeled "Test Images" to work with the script. Within the code, there is a graphic user interface (GUI) that helps direct the user through the steps to analyze a given image. At the end, the program will display a dialog box stating whether a cerebral infarction is present or not.
